A pokerNow stat tracker using python pandas. Simply download the pokerNow ledger and hand log and this stat tracker will be able to give you stats about your game.

I plan to add:
+ total hands played per player
+ bbs/100
+ VPIP
+ 3Bet Freq
+ XR Freq
+ Multi file support
+ More . . . 

Known bugs:
+ Away players are still added to hand count
+ rejoining for more than leaving stack improperly updates profit
