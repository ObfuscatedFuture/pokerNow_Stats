A pokerNow stat tracker using python pandas. Simply download the pokerNow ledger and hand log and this stat tracker will be able to give you stats about your game.

I plan to add:
+ 3Bet Freq
+ XR Freq
+ Multi file support
+ More . . . 

Known bugs:
+ Some random erroneous calculations due to unlikely events

I plan to add Shiny integration and will post link once that is made public
